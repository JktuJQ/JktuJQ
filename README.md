<h1 align=center>👋 Hi there! 👋</h1>
<p align="center">I'm Oleg, a tech enthusiast with never-ending passion to learn!</p>

## 👨‍💻 About me 👨‍💻

Currently, I am a student majoring in **"Applied mathematics and Computer Science"**.

As my future degree suggests, I do really like maths and I enjoy applying it to a real-world problems.
Even though I am not exposed to much of those in the university,
I try not to limit myself by home assignments projects andto participate in hackatons,
program my own ambitious projects and contribute in open-source libraries and frameworks.

I see **[my GitHub profile](https://github.com/JktuJQ)** as a great way to track my progress and (possibly) promote my skills to employers.

**My socials**:

## 🚀 My projects 🚀

There are a lot of my projects (and contributions), which are written in different programming languages and for different purposes.

To navigate around my projects, you can check out my **[stars](https://github.com/JktuJQ?tab=stars)**, which split repositories in several groups, or my pinned repositories.
Most of my **[repositories](https://github.com/JktuJQ?tab=repositories)** are thoroughly documented in 'README's, descriptions and in code, so it won't be hard for you to find whatever you are thinking.

Feel free to star projects that you like, and remember - any contributions are welcome!


## 💻 Technologies 💻

### Machine learning & Neural Networks

Once again, as my degree suggests,
*machine learning* and *neural networks* are the primary targets of my research.

Of course I use **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** paired with **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** and **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)**,
but I also like to use **[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)** to write safe, type-checked mathematical models from scratch (**[Synapse](https://github.com/JktuJQ/Synapse)** is my attempt at doing that).

### Web and app developing

I am fond of developing interactive interfaces to my applications.

Speaking of *web developing*, I am familiar with:

- **Python's** **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)** and **[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)** frameworks; **[Telegram](https://python-telegram-bot.org/)** and **[Discord](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** APIs

- **Rust's** **[Rocket](https://rocket.rs/)**, **[Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)**, **[Yew](https://yew.rs/)**, **[Tokio](https://tokio.rs/)** frameworks;
**[Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity)**, **[Poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise)** and **[Songbird](https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird)** frameworks for Discord API

- **Haskell's** **[Servant](https://www.servant.dev/)**

And in the *app development*, there is **[Qt](https://www.qt.io/product/framework)** (although I haven't used it in a while).

### Game developing and graphics

Games were always my passion; and once I learned programming - I could develop those, expressing my creativity however I want.

I enjoyed using **[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)** library and the **[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)** library derived from it.

I am also developing **[GGEngine](https://github.com/JktuJQ/GGEngine)** - 2d game engine built on top of **SDL2** that tries to implement Unity-like design.

Mentioning big game engines, I would say that **[Unity](https://unity.com/)** is my favorite, but I look forward to learn **[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US)** some day.

### Databases

I like to use both the plain query building and the ORMs working with *databases*, and those include **[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)** for **Python** and **[SQLx](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/)** for **Rust**.
